# MomSimulator

This is a local multiplayer game made for up to 8 players (in theory anyway). 
The game showcases ability to make playing games understandable and fun for middle aged people who have never touched a gamepad.

## Notes
Currently using xinput so it is limited to 4 players unfortunately.
